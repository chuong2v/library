This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).



## Get started
Let's cd into that directory.
```sh
cd library/
npm install
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.

The demo project includes the following tools and frameworks (most of them are already integrated by Create React App):
- React
- Redux
- Material UI
- webpack
- ES6

The flow would be like this:
